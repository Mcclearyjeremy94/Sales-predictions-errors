## Making predictions based off the outlet sales

### Business problem: How can we get the predicted outlet sales from other data from said outlet?
How can we get the predicted outlet sales from other data from said outlet?


### Data:
This data includes multiple supermarkets, their sales, their item types, information on the types of items sold, the visibilty on the items, and also the size of the supermarket themselves as well. I am predicting the item sales based on all the other information provided


## Methods
I have used linear regression and a decison tree model, then used the R^2 and RMSE method to figure out which model and method would give the best output

## Results
Based on doing both, R^2 and RMSE methods, on both the linear regression and decision tree models. I came to a conclusion that the linear regression, RMSE, model and method had the best possible output for this dataset.

####Item fat content compared to sales

#I would use the linear regression model here with this data set, the error is higher on the decision tree model therefore in my opinion the linear regression model will be best for future data.

#The RMSE in the linear regression model is the most important metric in my personal opinion. Since it is converting the error to the same unit and is also the smallest margin of error as well.
